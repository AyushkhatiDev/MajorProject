# HavenX

HavenX is a web application that allows users to explore various listings, add new places, and manage their experiences, similar to Airbnb. Users can log in, sign up, and log out while interacting with the listings. Although some features like map functionality are yet to be implemented, HavenX is designed to provide a seamless user experience.
